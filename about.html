            <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include:</p>
            <ul class="mb-3">
                <li>Visual perception and image recognition</li>
                <li>Speech recognition and natural language processing</li>
                <li>Decision-making and problem-solving</li>
                <li>Learning and adaptation</li>
                <li>Pattern recognition and prediction</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At its core, AI is about creating systems that can process information, learn from experience, and make intelligent decisions or predictions based on that learning.</p>

            <h2>A Brief History of AI</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>1950s - The Dawn of AI</h3>
                <p>The field of AI research was founded at a conference at Dartmouth College in 1956. The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined, and the first AI programs were created.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>1960s-1970s - Early Development</h3>
                <p>Researchers developed the first chatbots, expert systems, and programs that could solve mathematical problems and understand simple natural language.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>1980s-1990s - Expert Systems</h3>
                <p>AI found practical applications in specialized expert systems, but faced limitations in processing power and data availability.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>2000s-Present - The AI Revolution</h3>
                <p>Advances in computing power, big data, and machine learning algorithms have led to breakthroughs in AI capabilities, from self-driving cars to language models.</p>
            </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Narrow AI (ANI)</h3>
                    <p>Also known as Weak AI, these systems are designed for specific tasks. Examples include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa)</li>
                        <li>Image recognition software</li>
                        <li>Recommendation systems</li>
                        <li>Game-playing AI</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>General AI (AGI)</h3>
                    <p>Also called Strong AI, this theoretical form of AI would match or exceed human intelligence across all tasks. Currently, AGI remains in the realm of science fiction.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Superintelligent AI (ASI)</h3>
                    <p>A hypothetical future AI that would surpass human intelligence in every aspect. This concept raises important ethical and philosophical questions about the future of humanity.</p>

            <h2>Common Misconceptions About AI</h2>
            <div class="grid">
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>"AI Will Replace All Human Jobs"</h4>
                    <p>While AI will automate certain tasks, it's more likely to augment human work rather than completely replace it. New jobs and opportunities will emerge as AI technology evolves.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>"AI Systems Think Like Humans"</h4>
                    <p>AI systems process information differently from human brains. They excel at pattern recognition and specific tasks but lack human consciousness and general intelligence.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>"AI is Always Objective and Unbiased"</h4>
                    <p>AI systems can inherit biases from their training data and human creators. Ensuring fairness and addressing bias in AI is an important ongoing challenge.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>"AI Will Soon Take Over the World"</h4>
                    <p>Current AI systems are narrow in scope and lack the general intelligence needed for world domination. Ethical AI development focuses on beneficial AI that serves humanity.</p>
